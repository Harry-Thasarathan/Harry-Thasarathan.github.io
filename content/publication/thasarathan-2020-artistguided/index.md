abstract: 'A continuation of our work on automatic animation colorization, we extend our method to keep artist''s in the loop to simultaneously preserve artistic vision and reduce tedious animation workloads. By incorporating color hints and temporal information to an adversarial image-to-image framework, we show that it is possible to meet the balance between automation and authenticity through artist''s input to generate colored frames with temporal consistency.'
