#More recently, I've become interested in many topics from computer graphics and how we can leverage them to circumvent many of the problems in existing generative models by incorporating 3D information into neural representations. For example, recently I've been working on modeling human motion kinematics temporally using parameterized mesh for motion editing and synthesis for applications in digital avatars. Currently, I'm working on these problems at the Visual Computing Lab with Professor Faisal Qureshi. 
#My major interests are generative modeling at the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics and how we can apply them to improve traditional pipelines and workflows. More recently, I've been focusing my efforts on bridging concepts from computer graphics into deep learning for computer vision. The photorealism produced by the traditional rendering pipeline can provide useful insights to the structure of neural representations for real-time graphics problems. Currently, I'm working under the supervision of [Faisal Qureshi](http://vclab.science.uoit.ca/) at the Visual Computing Lab. situation change/end of summer/online most people say just note/letters

Hi there! I'm Harry, a fourth year computer science undergraduate student at Ontario Tech University. I've been fortunate enough to get involved in research early on in my undergrad career. Previously, I was supervised by [Mehran Ebrahimi](http://www.imaginglab.ca/index.html) at the Imaging Lab. It was here where I collaboratetd with [Kamyar Nazeri](https://knazeri.github.io/) to incorporate temporal coherence into the GAN framework for automatic video colorization and single-image super resolution.

For my undergraduate honors thesis, I've been working on problems at the intersection of computer vision and graphics. The main focus of my research is on structured generative models that learn physics constrained representations of human locomotion in 3D. I'm very fortunate to be working at the Visual Computing Lab under the supervision of [Faisal Qureshi](http://vclab.science.uoit.ca/) and [Ken Pu](http://db.science.uoit.ca/ken.pu/).
